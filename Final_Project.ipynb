    "## Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "The use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques has gained significant importance in recent years, offering a lot of potential in the transition towards renewable and non-renewable energy-based electrical infrastructures. One of the most promising areas for the application of these technologies is the forecasting of energy consumption and generation in energy markets. This project aims to explore a set of comprehensive datasets that contain four years worth of data related to electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather conditions in Spain. These sets of datasets are essential for understanding and predicting energy market dynamics and contributing to the transition to sustainable energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview:\n",
    "---\n",
    "The datasets we are working with here provides valuable information pertaining to the Spanish energy market. The data includes unique attributes/variables such as electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather conditions. The following data was gathered from various reputable sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electrical Consumption and Generation Data:** This dataset was collected from *European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity* (ENTSOE), a public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Settlement Prices:** The settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO, *Red Electric España* (REE).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather Data:** The weather data for the five largest cities in Spain was sourced from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, we will explore, clean, visualize, and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the energy market in Spain. Our objective is to ..."
